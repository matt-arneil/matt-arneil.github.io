I'm a co-founder of Stave Studios, find our game Over the Alps here: [Over The Alps Website](https://overthealpsgame.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/overthealpsgame), [Apple Arcade](https://apple.co/-OverTheAlps), [Nintendo Switch](https://apple.co/-OverTheAlps), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227400/Over_the_Alps/).
I was the lead developer on this project, my role included managing the code base, adding and maintaining features, and porting the game to each platform. I also contributed to many other areas such as audio. A major challenges was supporting 15 languages, which was especially demanding for a narrative game.
