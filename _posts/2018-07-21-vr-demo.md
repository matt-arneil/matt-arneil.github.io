#### Technical Design/Gameplay Code:
Built for Vive and Rift in Unity.
Uses OpenVR plugin and the new lightweight render pipeline.
Interactions - uses the OpenVR interaction system for teleportation as well as interacting with and throwing objects.
Player throws items to spawn turrets that stop enemies. Extra items can be bought from an "item shop" which provide new turret spawners in exchange for points earned from killing enemies.
UI - placed in world space, UI is positioned in the environment rather than in a HUD that is fixed in the player's view.
Scriptable objects - these can be used to easily set up custom waves of different numbers and types of enemies.
