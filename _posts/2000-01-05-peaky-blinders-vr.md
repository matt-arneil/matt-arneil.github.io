Working on *Peaky Blinders: The King’s Ransom* as a Senior Developer was an experience that pushed my development skills in new ways. As part of the core team, I played a major role in implementing the game’s features, often in a high pressure, fast paced environment. My goal was always to help bring the gritty, immersive world of 1920s Birmingham to life, and that required a lot of teamwork, creativity, and quick problem solving.

One of the most rewarding aspects was collaborating with the design and art teams to seamlessly integrate assets and mechanics. I supported designers with their visual scripting tools, ensuring their ideas could be rapidly prototyped and implemented as they envisioned. A technical challenge I faced was porting the game from *Meta Quest 2* to *ByteDance Pico 4*. I was tasked with completing this in a short time frame while maintaining the game’s quality, as well as enhancing the experience with the Pico's additional features, including advanced hand haptic feedback and eye tracked foveated rendering.

Perhaps the biggest test of my problem solving skills came when I replaced an existing underperforming interaction system with a new solution based on *Hurricane VR* in just two weeks. This upgrade transformed the player experience, making interactions feel more intuitive and fun, a change that was essential to the game as a whole. Another big issue that emerged was the stability of character animations. I replaced an advanced but unstable motion matching based animation system with a much more flexible and stable animation system based around *Animancer*. I enjoyed becoming familiar with motion matching but it ultimately wasn't suitable for the project. Joining the project after its initial inception meant that I could help bring perspective and resolve aspects that weren't adequate for the quality desired.

Working on *Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom* was an unforgettable project, and these challenges taught me a lot about balancing innovation with technical demands. It also reinforced the value of teamwork and mentorship, which played a huge role in helping us meet tight deadlines and deliver a compelling experience for players.

I helped support a wide variety of features in the project so I was familiar with all aspects of the code base. An example of some of the features I worked with are:
- Interaction System
- Core project structure
- Platform specific features such as saving and cloud saving integration
- Character set up - structure, scripting, animations
- Inverse kinematics for character head and eye tracking, as well as interacting with the world
- Character pathfinding
- Flexible and stable animation system based around *Animancer*.
- VR UI and Menus
- Player positioning, movement, and height adjustments
- Scene management
